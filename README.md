BluePill_Encoder_Timer

Just a attempt to program the Bluepill with the STM32CubeIde
Using the timer Encoder Mode functionality to read a rotary encoder
There is no great idea behind but if it can help ...

it uses a CP2102 to communicate via USB to Computer and a E38S6G5-600B-G24N encoder and a Led + integrated PC13 Led

Connections:
CP2102    BluePill    Encoder   Led
